## **1. Data Governance/Strategy for Life Sciences** (2.5 minutes)

### **Key Components Overview**
```
Clinical Data Governance:
âœ… Subject_ID standardization (ICH GCP compliance)
âœ… Biomarker measurements (Cotinine_Level validation) 
âœ… Age verification protocols (21 CFR 1140)

Pre-Clinical Data Governance:
âœ… Product characterization standards (ISO testing)
âœ… Laboratory data integration (LIMS API)
âœ… Quality control automation (95% accuracy)

Regulatory Data Governance:
âœ… FDA submission readiness (PMTA compliance)
âœ… Section 2.7-2.10 standards coverage
âœ… Automated compliance validation

Real-World Evidence (RWE):
âœ… Population surveillance integration
âœ… Epidemiological data standardization
âœ… Health outcome tracking (95% data quality)
```
