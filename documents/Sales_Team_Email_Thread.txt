Subject: RE: Q1 Inventory Issues - URGENT
Date: March 15, 2024

Team,

Following up on yesterday's call about the inventory discrepancies. Here's what we know:

1. WHS_LOC codes are getting mixed up again. Reminder:
   - WH-A = Cigarettes (main warehouse)
   - WH-B = Menthol/Specialty cigarettes 
   - WH-C = Smokeless tobacco products

2. The EXP_DT calculation is wrong in the system for smokeless products. 
   Should be 12 months from MFG_DT, not 24. This is causing compliance issues.

3. New FDA requirements for menthol tracking:
   - All menthol products MUST have CAT_CD = 02
   - Virginia Slims and Capri are menthol lines (update product master)
   - Need to track menthol percentage in new field

Sarah - also seeing issues with the retail data feed:

- RTL_ID formatting inconsistent (some have leading zeros, some don't)
- AGE_CHK_MTHD = "UNK" should trigger compliance review
- Missing LIC_SCAN data causing audit failures
- TAX_AMT calculations off for multi-pack purchases

The compliance team is asking for a clean dataset with proper field definitions. 
Current cryptic field names are causing training issues for new staff.

Critical issue: Found products with NULL nicotine values in cigarette category. 
This is a FDA violation. 

Business rules we need to enforce:
- Cigarettes (CAT_CD = 01, 02, 03) MUST have NIC_MG and TAR_MG
- Smokeless (CAT_CD = 05) should have NULL for tar, but we need nicotine equivalent data
- All products need valid SUPP_ID for supply chain traceability

Also, we're getting dinged on warning label compliance. Every retail transaction 
needs WARN_DSPL = Y, no exceptions.

Please clean up the data definitions. Regional managers are struggling to understand 
what COMP_STAT codes mean:
- COMP = Compliant sale
- VIOL = Violation (usually age verification failure)  
- QUEST = Questionable (needs manual review)

Thanks,
Lisa

Adding to Lisa's point - the product naming is a mess:

Current cryptic names vs what they should be:
- CIG-MAR-RED-100 → "Marlboro Red 100s"
- TOB-GRZ-NAT-1OZ → "Grizzly Natural Smokeless Tobacco 1oz"
- CIG-NEW-MEN-100 → "Newport Menthol 100s"

We need a proper business glossary. New employees can't figure out the product codes.

Also, PKG_SZ field is inconsistent:
- Cigarettes: count per pack (usually 20)
- Smokeless: weight in ounces
