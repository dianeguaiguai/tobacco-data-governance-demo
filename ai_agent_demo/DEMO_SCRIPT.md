## **Technical Backup Plan**
If the server isn't responding:
1. Show screenshots of the key interfaces
2. Focus on the business value and use case
3. Offer to run through the demo later or send a video walkthrough

**Most Important**: The story matters more than perfect technical execution. Focus on the transformation from manual to intelligent governance.
