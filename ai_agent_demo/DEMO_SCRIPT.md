## **MINUTE 1: The Problem & Vision (0:00-1:00)**

### **Opening Hook**
*"Imagine if your data governance could be as intelligent as your data science. Today I'll show you how AI transforms data governance from a compliance burden into a competitive advantage."*

### **Problem Setup**
*"Traditional data governance is manual, slow, and reactive. Data stewards spend 70% of their time on coordination instead of value creation. But what if AI could handle the routine work and provide intelligent guidance?"*

### **Navigate to Demo**
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:5002`
- Show the clean, professional interface
- Point out the three-tab structure

*"This is our AI-powered data governance platform. Let me show you how it works through a real pharmaceutical use case."*

## **MINUTE 2: Traditional Workflow (1:00-2:00)**

### **Tab 1: Data Governance Policy to Implementation**
- Click **"Data Governance Policy to Implementation"** tab
- Point to the comprehensive before/after comparison

*"Here's the transformation we deliver - from scattered, siloed data chaos to centralized, standardized, AI-powered governance."*

**Highlight the key transformations:**
1. **Before**: Data fragmented across disconnected systems ‚Üí **After**: Centralized metadata repository with 2,847 subjects, 347 clinical variables cataloged
2. **Before**: Manual compliance tracking ‚Üí **After**: Real-time monitoring with 98.7% CDISC compliance
3. **Before**: Reactive issue resolution ‚Üí **After**: Proactive AI alerts and recommendations

### **Show the FAIR Implementation Framework**
- Scroll to Component 2: The 5-step FAIR Framework
- Point to the visual progression: Discover ‚Üí Define ‚Üí Standardize ‚Üí Protect ‚Üí Govern

*"This is our proven 5-step FAIR framework that operationalizes data governance with measurable outcomes at each step."*

---

## **MINUTE 3: Real Implementation in Action (2:00-3:00)**

### **Tab 2: Use Cases & Implementation**
- Click **"Use Cases & Implementation"** tab
- Point to the four available use cases (note: only Individual Health is fully clickable)

*"This tab shows our governance framework in action across critical Life Sciences use cases - Product Description for nonclinical data, Individual Health for biomarkers, Population Health for surveillance, and Comprehensive Regulatory Compliance."*

[Select "Product Impact on Individual Health" use case - it will auto-select]

*"Let's examine our Individual Health implementation. Notice how our AI-driven 5-step lifecycle operationalizes FAIR principles with concrete, measurable metrics."*

### **Demonstrate the TIG Implementation Progress**
[Point to the TIG Section 3.3 Implementation Progress tracker]

*"Step 1 & 2 - Discover & Define: AI automatically found 15 SDTM domains, cataloged 347 clinical variables across 2,847 subjects, with 98% metadata coverage achieved in just 4.2 seconds. This is measurable discovery."*

[Click through Step 1 and Step 2 buttons]

*"Step 3 - Standardize: Each CDE links to regulatory requirements - ICH E6 for clinical data, FDA Bioanalytical guidance for biomarkers. AI ensures compliance while maintaining usability."*

[Click Step 3 button and point to the standardization content]

*"Current progress shows 6 biomarker CDEs fully standardized including Cotinine_Level and NNAL_Concentration with proper units, methods, and clinical significance."*

## **MINUTE 4: AI-Powered Intelligence & Results (3:00-4:00)**

### **Show Steps 4 & 5 - Protection and Governance**
[Click Step 4 and Step 5 buttons]

*"Steps 4 & 5 - Protect & Govern: Real-time compliance monitoring at 98.7% CDISC compliance, automated quality monitoring with 96.8% data quality scores, and comprehensive governance tracking."*

[Point to the quality metrics and compliance indicators]

*"Data maturity evolution is measurable - from baseline discovery to 96.8% current quality score, with submission prep time reduced to 14 days."*

### **Tab 3: AI Assistant Intelligence**
- Click **"ü§ñ AI Assistant"** tab
- Show the role-based AI interface

*"This is where the magic happens. Meet your AI Governance Copilot - it adapts to your role and provides intelligent, context-aware assistance."*

### **Demonstrate Role-Based Intelligence**
[Point to the different roles: Data Steward, Data Owner, IT Architect, Executive, Governance]

*"The AI provides role-specific insights. For executives, it tracks ROI and compliance. For data stewards, it provides operational guidance. Each role gets precisely the intelligence they need."*

### **Interactive AI Conversation**
- Click one of the quick question buttons like "What's my CDE status?" or "Show me compliance metrics"
- Demonstrate the contextual AI responses

*"Notice how the AI provides instant, intelligent responses with full context - no more hunting through spreadsheets or waiting for status meetings."*
