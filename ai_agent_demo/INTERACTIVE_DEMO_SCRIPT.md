## üöÄ **Demo Setup (30 seconds)**

**URL**: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### **Opening Hook:**
*"I'm going to show you an AI Data Governance Agent that doesn't just talk about transformation - it actually demonstrates it. Watch as we go from scattered data chaos to organized, compliant, FAIR data governance in real-time."*

---

## üìç **1. Before/After Visual Impact (2 minutes)**

### **Point to the Transformation Section:**
*"Let me start with the transformation story. On the left, you see the typical 'before' state that every data governance team knows too well..."*

**Walk through the "Before" pain points:**
- "Scattered data, no definitions - stewards spend 3 days hunting across 50+ systems"
- "No starting point for CDEs - manual identification takes weeks" 
- "Tribal knowledge trapped in documents and emails"
- "No clear ownership - SMEs unknown, lineage unclear"
- "Manual compliance checks - 3+ weeks for audit prep"

**Highlight the metrics:**
- "Time to Value: 3-6 months"
- "Cost: High manual effort, delayed projects"

### **Shift to "After" column:**
*"Now look at what happens with AI + Human collaboration..."*

**Walk through the "After" benefits:**
- "Draft metadata for 127 fields in 30 minutes"
- "44 high-priority CDEs suggested with 94-96% confidence"
- "Key terms extracted from documents automatically"
- "Draft list of SMEs identified by AI"
- "Automated compliance workflows - 2-day audit prep"

**Highlight the transformation:**
- "Time to Value: 2-3 weeks" 
- "ROI: $2M+ annually, 85% time savings"

## üé¨ **2. Interactive Demonstrations (6 minutes)**

*"Now let me show you exactly how this transformation works. I'll run four live demonstrations..."*

### **Demo 1: üîç Data Discovery (1.5 minutes)**

**Click "Demo Data Discovery" button**

*"Watch this side-by-side comparison. On the left, you see the manual process..."*

**While manual discovery is running:**
- *"System 1... System 2... Email archives... This goes on for days"*
- *"After day 1, only 12 assets found, and we're still searching"*

**Click "Start AI Discovery" button:**

*"Now watch the AI approach..."*

**As AI demo runs:**
- *"AI scans all systems simultaneously - no sequential hunting"*
- *"15 seconds: 8 databases scanned"*
- *"127 fields indexed across all sources"*
- *"Metadata catalog generated automatically"*
- *"Relationships and dependencies identified"*

**Point to results:**
- *"Total time: 30 minutes vs 3+ days"*
- *"85% time reduction - that's real transformation"*

### **Demo 2: üè∑Ô∏è CDE Identification (1.5 minutes)**

**Click "Demo CDE Identification" button**

*"CDE identification is typically a nightmare - weeks of manual review..."*

**Point to manual process:**
- *"127 fields to review manually"*
- *"Check against standards documents"*
- *"Consult multiple SMEs"*
- *"3-4 weeks of effort"*

**Click "Start AI CDE Analysis" button:**

*"Watch AI intelligence in action..."*

**As results appear:**
- *"High Priority CDEs with 96% confidence:"*
  - *"Patient_ID ‚Üí CDE_PATIENT_IDENTIFIER"*
  - *"Cotinine_Level ‚Üí CDE_COTININE_CONCENTRATION"*
  - *"Product_Type ‚Üí CDE_TOBACCO_PRODUCT_CATEGORY"*

- *"Medium Priority with 85% confidence for SME review"*

**Highlight the impact:**
- *"44 CDEs identified in 5 minutes"*
- *"SMEs only need to validate, not start from scratch"*
- *"95% time reduction"*

### **Demo 3: üìù Metadata Generation (1.5 minutes)**

**Click "Demo Metadata Generation" button**

*"Here's where AI really shines - generating rich metadata..."*

**Point to manual approach:**
- *"Look at this empty field - COT_LEVEL"*
- *"Definition: Empty, Data Type: Unknown, Business Rules: TBD"*
- *"2-3 hours per field manually"*

**Click "Generate AI Metadata" button:**

*"Watch AI context understanding..."*

**As metadata appears, read key elements:**
- *"Definition: 'Cotinine concentration in biological samples, measured as biomarker of tobacco exposure per FDA Section 2.7 guidelines'"*
- *"Data Type: Numeric (ng/mL)"*
- *"Business Rules: Range 0-500 ng/mL, ICH bioanalytical validation required"*
- *"Data Owner: Clinical Biomarker Team identified"*
- *"Related CDEs automatically linked"*

**Emphasize the transformation:**
- *"30 seconds vs 2-3 hours"*
- *"94% accuracy - SME review for regulatory precision"*

### **Demo 4: ‚úÖ Compliance Check (1.5 minutes)**

**Click "Demo Compliance Check" button**

*"Finally, compliance - traditionally weeks of manual work..."*

**Point to manual approach:**
- *"Manual checklists, document-by-document validation"*
- *"Multiple stakeholder reviews, spreadsheet tracking"*
- *"3+ weeks for full audit"*

**Click "Run AI Compliance Check" button:**

*"AI regulatory intelligence scanning..."*

**As results appear, walk through:**
- *"‚úÖ FDA Section 2.7 Compliance: PASSED"*
- *"‚úÖ Section 2.8 Nonclinical data: PASSED"*
- *"‚ö†Ô∏è Section 2.9 Population health: 3 minor gaps identified"*
- *"‚úÖ ICH Guidelines: COMPLIANT"*

**Highlight the outcome:**
- *"98% compliant overall"*
- *"Audit ready in 2 days vs 3+ weeks"*
- *"3 specific action items identified"*
