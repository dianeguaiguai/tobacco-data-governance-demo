"Today I'll show you an AI Data Governance Agent that transforms how we handle FAIR data principles and delivers measurable ROI."

## **1. Before/After Transformation (2 minutes)**

**Present the transformation section:**

"Let me start by showing you the transformation we can achieve. On the left, you see the typical 'before' state - scattered data with no definitions, weeks to identify CDEs, tribal knowledge trapped in documents, and unclear ownership. This usually takes 3-6 months to resolve manually."

**Point to the 'After' column:**

"With our AI agent plus human review, we can draft metadata for 127 fields in just 30 minutes, suggest 44 high-priority CDEs with 94-96% confidence, extract key terms from documents, and identify SMEs for review. This reduces time to value from months to 2-3 weeks."

**Highlight the key metrics:**

"The bottom line: 85% time reduction, 91% quality scores, 48 different AI contexts, and over $2M annual ROI. This isn't just efficiency - it's transformation."
