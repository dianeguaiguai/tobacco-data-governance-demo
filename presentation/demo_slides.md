# AI-Accelerated Data Governance Demo
## Data Governance Manager Interview - Tobacco Industry

---

## Slide 1: The Challenge We Face Today

### 🚨 Our Current Reality: Data Chaos
- **Scattered Data**: Product inventory, sales records across multiple systems
- **Cryptic Field Names**: PROD_ID, CAT_CD, NIC_MG, COMP_STAT - what do they mean?
- **Tribal Knowledge**: Critical business rules trapped in emails and documents
- **Compliance Risk**: FDA requirements, age verification, warning labels
- **Analytics Blocked**: Can't use data for AI/ML without understanding it first

### 💰 **Business Impact**
- Manual compliance reporting takes weeks
- New employee training delayed by unclear data
- Audit findings due to poor data documentation
- Analytics initiatives stalled
