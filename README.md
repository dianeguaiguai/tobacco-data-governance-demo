## üé¨ How to Run the Demo

### **Setup (5 minutes before presentation):**
1. Open the `sample_data/tobacco_product_inventory_messy.csv` file
2. Have `ai_prompts/live_demo_prompts.md` ready in another tab
3. Open your preferred AI assistant (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
4. Have the `templates/metadata_catalog_template.csv` open in Excel/Google Sheets

### **Demo Flow (10 minutes):**

#### **1. Show the Problem (2 minutes)**
- **Open** `tobacco_product_inventory_messy.csv`
- **Point out**: "What does PROD_ID mean? CAT_CD? NIC_MG? COMP_STAT?"
- **Show** `documents/` folder with scattered files
- **Narrate**: *"This is our reality today‚Äîdata scattered, no definitions, no clear ownership. If we want to use this for AI or analytics, we're stuck."*

#### **2. AI in Action (4 minutes)**

**Live Demo Part 1 (90 seconds):**
- Copy **Prompt 1** from `ai_prompts/live_demo_prompts.md`
- Paste the CSV content from `tobacco_product_inventory_messy.csv`
- Show AI generating business-friendly names and identifying CDEs

**Live Demo Part 2 (90 seconds):**
- Copy **Prompt 2** from the prompts file
- Paste content from `FDA_Compliance_Process_v2.txt`
- Show AI extracting business rules and compliance requirements

**Live Demo Part 3 (60 seconds):**
- Copy **Prompt 3** from the prompts file  
- Paste content from `Sales_Team_Email_Thread.txt`
- Show AI finding scattered tribal knowledge

#### **3. The "After" State (3 minutes)**
- Open `templates/metadata_catalog_template.csv`
- Show how AI outputs populate the structured template
- Highlight the transformation from chaos to reviewable metadata
- **Present the before/after slide** showing concrete results

#### **4. Implementation Roadmap (1 minute)**
- Show 3-phase implementation plan
- Emphasize scalability across tobacco compliance domains
- End with next steps and business value

## üéôÔ∏è Key Talking Points

### **Opening Hook:**
*"Data governance in tobacco is uniquely challenging‚ÄîFDA compliance, age verification, lot traceability. Traditional approaches take months. I want to show you how AI can turn chaos into compliance-ready structure in hours."*

### **During AI Demo:**
- *"AI doesn't replace human expertise‚Äîit accelerates the heavy lifting"*
- *"Notice how it identified nicotine content as a Critical Data Element for FDA compliance"*
- *"This email thread has business rules scattered throughout‚ÄîAI finds and structures them"*

### **Results Emphasis:**
- *"30 minutes of AI work vs 30 days of manual documentation"*
- *"From tribal knowledge to documented standards"*
- *"Compliance-ready from day one"*

### **Closing:**
*"This isn't just about efficiency‚Äîit's about transforming data governance from reactive to proactive, enabling the analytics and AI initiatives that will drive our business forward."*

## üìä Expected Demo Results

When you run the AI prompts, expect to generate:

### **Critical Data Elements Identified:**
- Product ID (PROD_ID) - Unique product identifier
- Lot Number (LOT_NUM) - Manufacturing traceability  
- Nicotine Content (NIC_MG) - FDA compliance requirement
- Age Verification (CUST_AGE_VERF) - Legal compliance
- Warning Display (WARN_DSPL) - Regulatory requirement
- Tax Classification (TAX_CD) - Excise tax compliance
- Regulatory Status (REG_STAT) - FDA approval tracking

### **Business Rules Extracted:**
- Cigarettes must have nicotine and tar values
- Menthol products require CAT_CD = 02
- Age verification mandatory for all tobacco sales
- Lot numbers follow LTYYYY[MM][DD][XX] format
- Expiration dates: 24 months for cigarettes, 12 for smokeless

### **Data Quality Checks:**
- Validate UPC format and uniqueness
- Check nicotine content ranges (0-20mg)
- Ensure age verification for all sales
- Cross-reference supplier IDs with master data
- Validate lot number format patterns

## ü§ù Questions You Might Get

**Q: "How do you ensure AI-generated metadata is accurate?"**
A: "AI provides the first draft‚Äîhuman domain experts validate and refine. It's about accelerating the process, not replacing expertise. The template includes SME review columns specifically for this."

**Q: "What about sensitive tobacco industry regulations?"**
A: "The AI identifies compliance requirements and flags them as Critical Data Elements. Human compliance experts review and finalize the rules. We maintain full control over the final definitions."

**Q: "How does this scale beyond tobacco products?"**
A: "Same process works for any data domain‚Äîclaims, financials, supply chain. The AI adapts to different business contexts while maintaining the structured approach to metadata creation."

**Q: "What's the ROI on this approach?"**
A: "Conservative estimate: 80% time savings on metadata creation, faster compliance reporting, reduced audit preparation time, and enabled analytics initiatives that were previously blocked by poor data documentation."
