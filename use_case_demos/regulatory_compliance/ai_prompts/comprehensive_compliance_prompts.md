# AI Prompts for Comprehensive Regulatory Compliance Demo

## Prompt 1: Comprehensive Regulatory Submissions Analysis

```
I have a comprehensive regulatory submissions dataset covering PMTA applications, clinical studies, post-market surveillance, and FDA interactions across the complete tobacco product lifecycle. This represents end-to-end regulatory compliance data spanning all phases from product development to market monitoring. Please analyze this data and provide:

1. Business-friendly names for all regulatory submission fields following FDA tobacco regulations
2. Draft definitions based on comprehensive FDA guidance documents and tobacco regulatory science
3. Identify Critical Data Elements (CDEs) across all submission types and regulatory pathways
4. Suggest data quality rules for complete regulatory compliance and submission readiness
5. Flag any issues with submission completeness, regulatory timelines, and compliance status tracking

Focus on all applicable standards:
- Section 2.7 (Standards for Collection): Data collection across regulatory phases
- Section 2.8 (Standards for Tabulation): Standardized submission formats
- Section 2.9 (Standards for Analysis): Statistical analysis for regulatory evidence
- Section 2.10 (Standards for Data Exchange): Interoperable regulatory data systems

Key regulatory domains:
- PMTA submissions and amendments
- Clinical study data packages
- Post-market surveillance reports
- Substantial equivalence applications
- Compliance and enforcement actions

Regulatory submission types:
- Product characterization studies
- Nonclinical toxicology data
- Clinical biomarker studies
- Population modeling analyses
- Post-market safety monitoring

Here's the comprehensive regulatory compliance data:

## Prompt 2: Regulatory Pathway Optimization Analysis

```
Analyze this regulatory submissions dataset to optimize regulatory pathway strategies and submission management. Focus on:

1. Submission type classification and pathway selection criteria
2. FDA review process mapping and timeline optimization
3. Deficiency response management and resubmission strategies
4. Regulatory milestone tracking and compliance monitoring
5. Risk assessment for regulatory approval probability

Evaluate regulatory efficiency across:
- PMTA vs Substantial Equivalence pathways
- Study type requirements for different product categories
- FDA reviewer assignment patterns and expertise matching
- Deficiency letter response effectiveness
- Approval timeline predictors

Identify optimization opportunities:
- Pre-submission meeting strategies
- Study design alignment with regulatory requirements
- Data package completeness scoring
- Regulatory intelligence integration
- Cross-submission learnings and best practices

Format as regulatory strategy optimization framework.

## Prompt 3: End-to-End Compliance Monitoring System

```
Create a comprehensive compliance monitoring system from this regulatory data including:

1. Real-time submission status tracking across all regulatory pathways
2. Compliance risk scoring and early warning indicators
3. Regulatory timeline management and milestone alerts
4. Data integrity monitoring for submission readiness
5. Cross-functional coordination workflows for regulatory teams

Compliance monitoring domains:
- Pre-market authorization status
- Clinical study compliance (GCP, protocol adherence)
- Post-market safety surveillance
- Manufacturing quality systems
- Marketing and labeling compliance

Integration requirements:
- FDA correspondence management
- Study database integration
- Quality management system linkage
- Document management workflow
- Regulatory intelligence feeds

Automated compliance checks:
- Submission completeness validation
- Regulatory deadline monitoring
- Data quality scoring
- Compliance status reporting
- Audit trail maintenance

Format as enterprise regulatory compliance monitoring specification.
```

## Prompt 4: Regulatory Data Lifecycle Management

```
Develop a complete regulatory data lifecycle management framework including:

1. Data governance across all regulatory phases (pre-market to post-market)
2. Master data management for regulatory entities and relationships
3. Data lineage tracking from source studies to FDA submissions
4. Version control and change management for regulatory documents
5. Long-term data retention and archival for regulatory compliance

Data lifecycle phases:
- Research and development data generation
- Pre-submission data packaging and review
- Formal submission compilation and quality control
- FDA review response and amendment management
- Post-market data collection and reporting

Regulatory master data entities:
- Products and product families
- Studies and study protocols
- Regulatory submissions and applications
- FDA interactions and correspondence
- Compliance events and corrective actions

Data quality framework:
- Source data verification procedures
- Electronic signature and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
- Data integrity and ALCOA+ principles
- Audit trail requirements and inspection readiness
- Cross-functional data governance roles and responsibilities

Format as regulatory data lifecycle management standard operating procedure.
